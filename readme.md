1. Foundational Concepts
Django’s Test Framework: Learn how Django’s built-in testing tools work (e.g., TestCase, Client).
Unit Tests: Writing tests for individual components like models and utility functions.
Integration Tests: Testing how multiple components (e.g., views and models) work together.
Functional Tests: Testing end-to-end user flows using tools like Selenium or Playwright.
Types of Tests: Understand differences between setUp/tearDown, setUpTestData, and fixtures.
2. Model Testing
Validating models, field constraints, and validators.
Testing model methods (e.g., save(), clean()).
Ensuring database integrity (e.g., foreign keys, cascading deletes).
Edge case testing (e.g., max/min values for fields).
3. Views and API Testing
Django Views: Test both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).
Django REST Framework (DRF):
Testing serializers, permissions, and views.
Writing tests for custom DRF pagination and filtering.
Using APIClient for endpoint testing.
Error and Edge Cases:
Handling 404, 500, and other HTTP status codes.
Testing redirects and access permissions.
4. Form and Serializer Testing
Validating form inputs (e.g., is_valid() behavior).
Testing custom form logic and clean() methods.
Writing tests for DRF serializers, especially those with custom validation logic.
5. Authentication and Authorization
Testing login/logout functionality.
Role-based access control:
Ensuring only authorized users can access certain views.
Testing Django’s built-in User model and permissions.
Verifying middleware behaviors (e.g., LoginRequiredMiddleware).
6. Database and Query Testing
Testing custom querysets and managers.
Measuring performance of database queries in tests.
Using Django’s assertNumQueries to check query counts.
7. Middleware Testing
Testing custom middleware (e.g., logging, caching, or access control).
Ensuring middleware behavior under various request/response conditions.
8. Third-Party Integrations
Testing external API integrations (e.g., mocking API calls).
Writing tests for third-party libraries used in the project.
9. Frontend Testing
Testing templates for correct rendering.
Validating context data passed to templates.
Testing JavaScript interactions with Django backend (e.g., using Selenium or Playwright).
10. Asynchronous Testing
Testing asynchronous tasks with Celery or Django’s async views.
Mocking background jobs and external task queues.
11. Advanced Topics
Mocking external services (e.g., APIs, email services, payment gateways).
Writing reusable test utilities for your project.
Using Django’s TestCase with fixtures, factories, or pytest-django.
Generating test data dynamically (e.g., with Faker or Factory Boy).
12. Performance and Scalability
Load testing for high-traffic endpoints.
Stress testing your database.
Testing caching mechanisms for correct behavior.
13. Test Coverage and Best Practices
Measuring test coverage with tools like coverage.py.
Writing comprehensive yet efficient tests.
Organizing test files and reusable utilities.
Mocking and patching: Deciding when and how to mock.
14. CI/CD Testing
Setting up test pipelines in CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
Writing tests that are compatible with Dockerized environments.
Using parallel testing to speed up execution.
Tools and Libraries to Explore:
Pytest: More concise syntax, plugins for Django.
Factory Boy: Creating test data with factories instead of fixtures.
Faker: Generating random but realistic test data.
Mock: Patching objects and mocking behaviors.
Selenium: End-to-end testing with browser automation.
Playwright: Modern alternative to Selenium.
pytest-django: Pytest integration with Django.
